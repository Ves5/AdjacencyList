# Build and install
```sh
python setup.py build # building
python setup.py install # installing to global package python repo (works like normal import now)
```

# Testing
```sh
./test.py -t AdjacencyList
./test.py -t AdjacencyList create_star
```

# Pre-tests
`trial.py` for initial tests after installing the package, also good for debugging
